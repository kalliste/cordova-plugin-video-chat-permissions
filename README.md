A Simple video chat permissions plugin

At least with <a href="https://crosswalk-project.org/">Crosswalk</a> it is possible to access the camera and microphone using getUserMedia() but Android wants some extra permissions for this that the Crosswalk plug-in itself doesn't ask for. This simple plug-in adds the necessary permissions.
