A Simple video chat permissions plugin

At least with <a href="https://crosswalk-project.org/">Crosswalk</a> it is possible to access the camera and microphone using getUserMedia() but Android wants some extra permissions for this that the Crosswalk plugin itself doesn't ask for. This simple plugin adds the necessary permissions.
